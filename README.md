# Revenue Prediction**

**Problem Statement:**

Create a machine learning model to predict revenue of the restaurant based on
the features present in the dataset.

**Dataset Attributes:**

1. ID - Restaurant ID
2. Name - Name of the Restaurant
3. Franchise - Restaurant has franchise or not
4. Category - specific type of category provided by restaurant
5. No_of_item - Different types of items provided by restaurant
6. Order_Placed - Order placed by customer to restaurant (in lacs)
7. Revenue - Total amount of income generated by the restaurant.


**Tasks To Be Performed:**

In this project, you have to predict the restaurant revenue based on the
independent features using a machine learning algorithm of your own choice.


**CENSUS INCOME**

**Problem Statement:**

In this project, initially you need to preprocess the data and then develop an understanding of the different features of the data by performing exploratory
analysis and creating visualizations. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes, you will perform a predictive task of classification to predict
whether an individual makes over 50,000 a year or less by using different machine learning algorithms.

**Tasks To Be Performed:**

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to find key insights.
2. Use various machine learning algorithms to predict the response variable.

**Dataset.**
